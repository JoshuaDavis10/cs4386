QUESTIONS FOR MONDAY:
- for FACTOR node: how to indicate that ident/num/boollit are not being used (cuz for expression we just set it NULL)
    -> would it be better to have node types for these leaves so we can set them to null? or should i just have some flag value like -999999
       or smn?
- for TYPE node: how to store if it's an INT or BOOL? boolean flags for each?
- for EXPRESSION/SIMPLEEXPRESSION/TERM nodes: we will know which option of the RHS ( x | y <- for example) we are choosing based on if one of the 
children nodes is NULL?
